How to obtain the postfix arithmetic expression:
To change into postfix evaluation one should just change the order of reading
from the scanner. In a postfix expression the first Token is the leftExpr,
the second Token is the rightExpr, and the third Token is the operation. The 
rest of the codes need not be changed.

To print out out the arithmetic expression in postfix notation,
simply create the given string described by the folowing recursive pseudo-code
    -find the postfix string representation of the right node tree
        -call it a
    -find the postfix string representation of the left node tree
        -call it b
    -find the string representation of the node
        -call it c
    -print out the string a + b + c
