How to obtain the postfix arithmetic expression:
To change into postfix evaluation one should just change the order of reading
from the scanner. In a postfix expression the first Token is the leftExpr,
the second Token is the rightExpr, and the third Token is the operation. The 
rest of the codes need not be changed.
